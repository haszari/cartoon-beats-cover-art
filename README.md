# Cartoon Beats - Cover Art Generator

This is a React app to help me protoype and lay out cover art for [Cartoon Beats Reality](https://cartoonbeats.com/releases/) releases.

To tweak the cover details, edit the source for App.js.

- Set the EP/song title with `TitleLine` component(s).
- Change the colours used for the mixer logo stripes.
- Set the catalogue number.

Coming soon: background image.

`yarn start` and visit http://localhost:3000/ to view the cover.
